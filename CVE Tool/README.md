# Final Project: CVE Information and Report

## Description
This Python-based web application retrieves information on Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) based on user input. It aggregates and scrapes data from multiple online sources. Additionally, the application features integrated AI that summarizes CVE-related information. It also includes an email functionality that allows users to send the output to a designated email address.

## Core Dependencies 
Flask: A micro web framework used for developing the web application.
Requests: For making HTTP requests to external APIs.
Beautifulsoup4: For parsing HTML and scraping web data.
Selenium: For automating web browser interactions (used for scraping verified exploits).
Google-generativeai: For interacting with the Google Generative AI model.
Python-docx: For generating DOCX files.
fpdf: For generating PDF files.
smtplib: For sending emails.
